			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Introducing 2D picture mode: the picture is represented in 2D, flat against the wall. This eliminates parallax issues.</p>
				<p>When a picture is moved, all the pictures on that wall automatically go 2D. When the move is completed, the pictures
				automatically return to 3D.</p>
				<p>The wall grid lines are now either black or red to make them more prominent.</p>
				<p>Other bug fixes.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="release">
				1.3.2.1

			<td class="date">

				<p>Fixed bug in new style wall grids that happened when reopening files.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="release">
				1.3.2
			</td>
			<td class="date">
				9/30/2018
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>The wall grids now have one foot squares marked in red.</p>
				<p>When moving a picture, the picture is replaced by a gray, semi-transparent rectangle flat on the wall, so that placement can be made without parallax confusion.</p>
				<p>The hanging map now reports the height above the floor of the top edge of the picture,
				and the distance of the picture's center from the center of the previous picture, or
				the left edge of the wall in the case of the first picture.</p>

				<p>Spotlights! Add (or remove) them using the picture contextual menu.</p>

			<td class="release">
				1.3.1

			<td class="date">

				<p>Fixed bug with moving tables. Fixed bug with resizing pictures.</p>

		<tr>
			<td class="release">
				1.3.0.1
			</td>
			<td class="date">
				9/25/2018
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Fixed small bug with respect to initial position of a chair.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="release">
				1.3.0
			</td>
			<td class="date">
				9/24/2018
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>There are two new types of objects you can add to the floor: chairs and tables. Add them through the floor contextual menu. The contours of these new complex shapes resulted
				in the failure of my previous methods for detecting object collisions, which were the basis of making these objects seem solid. For the time being, all objects pass through
				other objects.</p>
				<p>There is a new menu item for the room lights. You can change the intensity of the ambient and omni lights. Ambient light is non-reflective and non-directional. The omni light is attached to the camera, casts shadows, and creates highlights. The lights panel also has a slider for the intensity of spotlights. But since there aren't any spotlights yet, this slider does nothing.</p>
				<p>As usual, miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements.</p>

				<p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Boxes!</p>
				<p>We now have boxes (rectangular prisms), which can be used to represent furniture or other objects on the floor of the gallery. Place one by right-clicking on a location
				on the floor and selecting Add Box from the menu. As you move the mouse over the faces,
				the cursor will change shape to indicate that a drag will change the box's size or position. Right-click on the box to get a menu to delete the box, change its size or
				position with the keyboard, or change its color.</p>
				<p>The last release killed Get Info. It's back.</p>
				<p>As usual, miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements.</p>
