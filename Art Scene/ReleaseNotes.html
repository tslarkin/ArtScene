				<p>We now have boxes (rectangular prisms), which can be used to represent furniture or other objects on the floor of the gallery. Place one by right-clicking on a location
				on the floor and selecting Add Box from the menu. As you move the mouse over the faces,
				the cursor will change shape to indicate that a drag will change the box's size or position. Right-click on the box to get a menu to delete the box, change its size or
				position with the keyboard, or change its color.</p>
				<p>The last release killed Get Info. It's back.</p>
				<p>As usual, miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements.</p>
